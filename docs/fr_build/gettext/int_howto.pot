msgid "On the Welcome dialog's **Create New Project** form, you can select to \"Prefill Project\" from the content of a different project. This feature is most useful if you copy a project you have dedicated to be a template project. If you have a structure and settings you want to use for every new project, this is the best solution."

#: ../../source/int_howto.rst:30
msgid "If you need to merge a selection of documents in your project into a single document, you can achieve this by first making a new folder for just that purpose, and drag all the documents you want merged into this folder. Then you can right click the folder, select :guilabel:`Transform` and :guilabel:`Merge Documents in Folder`."

#: ../../source/int_howto.rst:52
msgid "The formatting tools available in novelWriter don't allow for complex structures like tables. However, the editor does render tabs in a similar way that regular word processors do. You can set the width of a tab in **Preferences**."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/int_howto.rst:56
msgid "The tab key should have the same distance in the editor as in the viewer, so you can align text in columns using the tab key, and it should look the same when viewed next to the editor."

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/int_howto.rst:65
msgid "In the **Manuscript Build Settings** you can choose to ignore line breaks within paragraphs in your text. However, some times you still need those breaks. Like for instance on the cover page where you may need to add your name and address. In such cases, you can add ``[br]`` where you want line breaks. These breaks cannot be ignored by any settings and will always be respected."

#: ../../source/int_howto.rst:75
msgid "If you have first line indent enabled, but have a specific paragraph that you don't want indented, you can disable the indentation by explicitly adding text alignment. For instance by adding ``<<`` to the end to left-align it. Aligned paragraphs are not indented."

#: ../../source/int_howto.rst:91
msgid "If you add separate files for chapters and scenes, the chapter file is the perfect place to add such text. Separating chapter and scene files also allows you to make scene files child documents of the chapter."

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/int_howto.rst:98
msgid "Depending on your writing style, you may need to separate between soft and hard scene breaks within chapters. Like for instance if you switch point-of-view character often."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/int_howto.rst:101
msgid "In such cases you may want to use different scene headings for hard and soft scene breaks. The **Build Manuscript** tool will let you define a different format for scenes using the ``###`` and ``###!`` heading codes when you generate your manuscript. You can for instance add the common \"``* * *``\" for hard breaks and select to hide soft scene breaks, which will just insert an empty paragraph in their place. See :ref:`a_manuscript_settings` for more details."
